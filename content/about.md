In the natural sciences, conducting data collection in the field can be critical to completing a graduate program. Graduate students may be responsible for coordinating, planning and leading their own graduate fieldwork, but often receive very little explicit training in field leadership, particularly in the "soft" interpersonal skills required to manage a field team successfully (and often, their mentors or departments may not have received formal training as well).

This project collects advice, resources and strategies for graduate students (and indeed, field researchers across career stages) who conduct, manage and lead fieldwork.
